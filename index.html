    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is <em>Mattias</em> or <em>Matt</em> for short and i've been living in Vancouver for all my life. I was originally in BCIT for Architecture in the ABT program and now i'm pursing something more related to tech specifically <strong> Cybersecurity</strong> so my computer knowledge is very basic. My hobbies are playing the guitar, martial arts, and some light gaming. My expectations are to increase my knowledge in the tech field and am excited to learn as much as possible!</p>

    <p> Some of my favorite courses I am taking are: </p>
