        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is <em>Mattias</em> or <em>Matt</em> for short and i've been
          living in Vancouver for all my life. I was originally in BCIT for
          Architecture in the ABT program and now i'm pursing something more related
          to tech specifically <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> so my computer
          knowledge is very basic. My hobbies are playing the guitar, martial arts,
          and some light gaming. My expectations are to increase my knowledge in the
          tech field and am excited to learn as much as possible!
        </p>
